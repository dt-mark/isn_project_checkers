# Contributing Guidelines

For the moment, we won't be accepting any pull requests. We appreciate your interest,
but this is a personal project and GitHub was the easiest way to organise ourselves.

In the future, after the project has been marked, we will accept pull requests. Take 
into account that we may have forgotten about the project and your request will not
be reviewed. We recommend you fork this project so you're able to edit it freely, as
long as you follow the guidelines we set in the README.md
